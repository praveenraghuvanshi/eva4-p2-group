PoseResNet is based on the ResNet-50 model similarto the GoogLeNet modifications  that resulted in PoseNet, ResNet-50 is modified for PoseResNet by replacing the classification output layer with a fully connected feature layer. 

The method used in this network adds a few deconvolutional layers over the last convolution stage in the ResNet architecture. This structure makes it very easy to generate heatmaps from deep- and low-resolution images. Three deconvolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation are used by default.

Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the loss between the predicted heatmaps and targeted heatmaps. The targeted heatmap for a joint is generated by applying a 2D Gaussian centered on the joint’s ground truth location with std dev = 1 pixel.
The model is trained by minimizing the Mean Squared-Error (MSE) distance of predicted heat-map to a target heat-map (The target is a 2D Gaussian of constant variance (σ ≈ 1-1.5 pixels) centered at the ground-truth joint location
